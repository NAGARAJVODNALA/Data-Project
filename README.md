# Data Engineer Test - Supermarket Transactions Analysis & Maze Navigation

## Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing supermarket transaction data collected over two years to generate valuable business insights. It consists of two main tasks:  
1. Supervised Learning for Business Insights – Using Machine Learning to predict sales, assess promotional impacts, and classify high-performing supermarkets.  
2. Maze Navigation Model – Implementing reinforcement learning to train an agent to navigate a maze efficiently.  

The goal is to clean, normalize, and transform data into Python-compatible formats while leveraging Machine Learning techniques for predictive modeling and decision-making.
