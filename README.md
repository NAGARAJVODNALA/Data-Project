# 🛒 Data-Project: Supermarket Transactions Analysis & Maze Navigation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves analyzing **supermarket transaction data** collected over **two years** to generate **valuable business insights**.  
It consists of two main tasks:  

1️⃣ **Supervised Learning for Business Insights** – Using Machine Learning to **predict sales**, assess **promotional impacts**, and classify **high-performing supermarkets**.  
2️⃣ **Maze Navigation Model** – Implementing **Reinforcement Learning** to train an agent to **navigate a maze efficiently**.  

The goal is to **clean, normalize, and transform** data into **Python-compatible formats** while leveraging **Machine Learning techniques** for predictive modeling.

## 📊 Task 1: Supervised Learning for Business Insights  

### **📌 Data Sources**  
The project uses **four datasets**:  

- 📄 **Items.csv** – Product details (**code, type, brand, size**)  
- 📄 **Sales.csv** – Sales transactions (**amount, units, time, customer ID, voucher**)  
- 📄 **Promotion.csv** – Promotions applied to items (**week, display impact, feature**)  
- 📄 **Supermarkets.csv** – Supermarket locations (**supermarket number, post-code**)  

---

### **✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
✔ Removed **duplicates**  
✔ Standardized **column names** and formatted **data types**  
✔ Merged datasets on **common keys** (`code`, `Supermarket_No`, `province`)  

---

### **✅ Feature Engineering**  
✔ Created new **features** to **capture sales patterns**  
✔ Extracted **time-related insights** (`month`, `weekday`)  
✔ Mapped **promotional impact**  

---

## **✅ Model Training & Evaluation**  

### **1️⃣ Sales Forecasting (Regression Model)**

- 🎟 **Promotion-related:** `Promotion Active`  
**🔹 Evaluation Metric:** **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- Achieved a strong **RMSE score**, indicating accurate predictions  

---

### **2️⃣ Supermarket Performance Classification (Classification Model)**  
**🔹 Problem Statement:** Classify supermarkets into **high-performing (1) and low-performing (0)**.  
**🔹 Algorithm Used:** RandomForestClassifier  
**🔹 Features Used:**  
- 📅 `Month`, `Weekday`  
- 🏷 `code`, `Promotion Active`, `Display Impact`  
**🔹 Evaluation Metric:** **Accuracy Score**  
- The model achieved **high accuracy**, confirming the importance of key features  

---

### **📈 Business Insights**  
✔ **📊 Promotion Impact:** Sales were significantly **higher when promotions were active**  
✔ **🛒 Weekend Sales Surge:** Transactions **peaked on weekends**  
✔ **🏬 High-Performing Stores:** Certain supermarkets **outperformed others due to location & promotions**  
✔ **💰 Customer Segmentation:** High spenders **contributed disproportionately to sales**

## 🎯 Task 2: Maze Navigation Using Reinforcement Learning  

### **📌 Objective**  
Design a **reinforcement learning model** where an agent **learns to navigate** a **10x10 maze** while **avoiding obstacles**.  

---

### **✅ Approach**  
✔ **Q-learning Algorithm:** Uses a **Q-table** to store values for each state-action pair.  
✔ **Rewards System:**  
  - ✅ **+100** for reaching the goal  
  - 🚶 **-1** for moving to a valid path  
  - ❌ **-10** for hitting a wall  
✔ **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Uses an **epsilon-greedy policy** to balance learning and optimal decision-making.  
✔ **Performance:** Over **30 training iterations**, the agent **improves navigation efficiency**.  

---

## **📊 Training Results & Performance Analysis**  
✔ **Tracked agent movement** for **30 iterations**  
✔ **Observed a decreasing trend in steps**, indicating **successful learning**  
✔ **Plotted a learning curve (iterations vs. steps to goal)**  
✔ **Real-time visualization** demonstrated the agent’s progress
